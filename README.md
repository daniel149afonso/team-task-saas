# Team Task Manager

## Description

Team Task Manager is a full-stack SaaS web application designed to help teams organize and track their work. The goal is to provide a simple, structured environment where users can create teams, assign tasks to those teams, and follow the progress of each task through three statuses: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

The application is split into two independent services:

- A **React** single-page application (frontend) that communicates with the API over HTTP.
- An **Express** REST API (backend) backed by a **PostgreSQL** database managed through **Prisma ORM**.

Users authenticate via JWT tokens. All task and team data is scoped behind authentication, so each session is private and secure.

## Features

- User registration and login with hashed passwords (bcrypt) and JWT tokens
- Create and list teams
- Create, update, and delete tasks linked to a team
- Filter tasks by team
- Task status tracking: `todo` → `doing` → `done`
- Protected routes — unauthenticated requests are redirected to login

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or higher
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) running locally (default port `5432`)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd team-task-saas
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@localhost:5432/team_task_manager?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

Apply the database migrations and generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Start the backend development server (runs on port `3000`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Set up the frontend

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on port `5173` and opens automatically in the browser.

### AI usage

Claude (claude.ai / Claude Code CLI) was used during this project for the following tasks:

- **Debugging**: Diagnosing a `Failed to fetch` error caused by the `User` model being missing from the Prisma schema, and generating the correct migration.
- **Code review**: Identifying that the backend was returning 500 errors on `/auth/register` due to `prisma.user` not existing in the generated client.
- **Boilerplate generation**: Scaffolding the Express route structure and Prisma schema definitions.
- **Documentation**: Drafting this README based on the actual project structure and code.
